<h1>Problem</h1>

Let there be N workers and N jobs. Any worker can be assigned to perform any job, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the work-job assignment. It is required to perform all jobs by assigning exactly one worker to each job and exactly one job to each agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized. Write a program using branch and bound strategy to show who will be assigned which job and the total cost incurred.
